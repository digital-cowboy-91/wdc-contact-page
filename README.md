## Assignment

Prior to the interview we would like for you to rebuild the contact page from our website - https://www.wdc-creative.com/contact. Please spend 2 hours on this task and once completed provide us with a link to review.

## Solution

### Stack

1. Next.js (React)
2. Tailwind

### Preparation

I spent approximately 10 minutes studying the page's structure before coding. This brief preparation resulted in a list of tasks I planned to achieve

1. Layout
   1. Navbar
      1. S1: horizontal
      2. S2: vertical
   2. Sidebar component
   3. Footer component
2. Page
   1. Header component
      1. S1: basic layout
      2. S2: animate
      3. S2: font
   2. Form component
      1. S1: basic layout
      2. S2: form validation
      3. S2: componentize contact block
   3. Map component 2. S1: render static image 3. S2: render interactive map

Note: S1/S2 => Stages

### Coding

The entire two-hour coding session was recorded to demonstrate that I followed the rules. While I wasn't able to achieve all my goals I am quite happy with the final result. If I had had access to the original font and prior knowledge of Google Maps React library, the majority of the tasks would have been completed. This coding session best showcase my:

- workflow
- knowledge of JS, React and Tailwind (CSS)
- problem solving and critical thinking
- ability to follow rules and design
